# PacketSniffer
A small project I'm working on. The goal is to create a packet sniffer that records network traffic via packet capture and functions in a terminal application. The intention of this program is to assist in anaylization of network traffic which can be used to gain insight into security threats/issues within a network.

This is a project to help me gain better understanding of socket programming and terminal application programming. I am not the best programmer, so any help is appreciated.
