# PacketSniffer
A small project I'm working on. The goal is to create a packet sniffer that records network traffic via packet capture and functions in a window application.

This is a project to help me gain better understanding of socket programming and Window application programming, so any help is appreciated.

I am currently using eel to run the application.
