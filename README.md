# PacketSniffer
A small project I'm working on. The goal is to create a packet sniffer that records network traffic via packet capture and functions in a window application. The intention of this program is to assist in anaylization of network traffic which can be used to gain insight into security threats/issues within a network.

This is a project to help me gain better understanding of socket programming and Window application programming while also gaining knowledge in a variety of different languages and specialized areas within those languages which explains the variety of different languages that may appear over the course of this project. I am not the best programmer, so any help is appreciated.

I am currently using eel to run the application.
